                    <h3>DEPARTMENT OF BIOCHEMISTRY</h3>
                    <p>
                      Clinical Biochemistry Laboratory at HBCH became
                      operational on the 1st May, 2018. Biochemistry
                      Laboratory has also been set up at MPMMCC, Varanasi
                      and has been functional since February 2019. Both
                      the laboratories are equipped with high-end and high
                      throughput state of art auto analysers and have been
                      participating in internal and external quality
                      assurance schemes providing a very strong base to
                      support the reporting of patient results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We have an extensive test menu of nearly 100+
                      assays. During the period 01.01.2021 to 31.12.2021,
                      the laboratory performed more than 8.5 lakhs Routine
                      Biochemistry tests on an average TAT of 3 hours and
                      for Emergency within 2 Hours. Along with routine
                      Biochemistry, the lab has performed more than 35000
                      Tumor Marker tests. Currently, the lab processes on
                      an average 600 samples each day, maintaining the
                      best TAT. The Department provides 24/7 laboratory
                      services. We have introduced Therapeutic Drug
                      Monitoring services by HPLC and also Myeloma test
                      services to our existing panel. We are further
                      working towards the establishment of metabolomics
                      lab. The laboratory has actively provided services
                      24/7 during the COVID pandemic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The Laboratory is participating actively in 3
                      research projects. We await to be a NABL accredited
                      laboratory at the earliest possible.
