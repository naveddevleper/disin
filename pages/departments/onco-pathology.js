                                            Department of Oncopathology provides a wide range of
                                            in-house diagnostic services of histopathology, fine
                                            needle aspiration cytology, exfoliative cytology, frozen

                                            pathology tests for patients treated at MPMMCC/HBCH as
                                            well as for referral cases from outside hospitals. The
                                            laboratory is well-equipped with automated tissue
                                            processors, automated slide stainers, automated

                                            diagnostic, predictive and prognostic markers are enabled
                                            in the department both through automated and manual
                                            methods. An extensive panel of IHC markers are available
                                            in the department, numbering almost 140, which greatly
                                            helps in achieving the precise diagnosis and also in
                                            predicting response to certain targeted therapies, in
                                            otherwise terminally ill cancer patients, whose only
                                            management remains palliative care. Thus, such tests with
                                            positive outcomes manifest as a ray of hope for these most
                                            unfortunate patients. For reporting as well as teaching
                                            purposes, the department utilizes mono-header, bi-header
                                            and penta-head microscopes. Histopathology reporting is
                                            done on Synoptic Reporting System and cytopathology
                                            reporting is done in DIS. All the pathology reports are
                                            linked to Electronic Medical Record (EMR).

                                            cancer, has been greatly benefitted. Also, the dependency
                                            of this institute on the parent institute of Tata Memorial
                                            Hospital, Mumbai has lessened. The Department is hopeful
                                            that in the very near future, it will become self-reliant
                                            in offering a varied range of critical molecular pathology
                                            services.

                                            of various diseases and diagnostic confirmation of some.
